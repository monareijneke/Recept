Put the dark chocolate in a bain-marie or water bath together with the coconut oil and melt.  
Once melted, remove from the heat, add the maple syrup in and mix well.  
Leave this bowl on the bain marie to keep it liquid.  
Break up the biscuits into small pieces.  
Line a 2lb loaf tin with baking parchment and transfer the broken biscuits.  
Roughly chop the walnuts into small bite sized pieces and add to the cookies in the tin along with any dried fruit.  
Pour the chocolate over them and spread so that all the cookies are covered.  
Leave to cool to set fully and for quickest results, put in the freezer but the fridge also works well.
